### Hello GitHub ðŸ‘‹

<!--
Iâ€™m currently working on redesigning my company's website. I am the third generation owner of Hooks Crane Service, a small crane rental company located in Southeastern Washington State, USA.

Iâ€™m currently learning Laravel.

I'm also interested in electronic music. I'm currently learning sequencing and sampling on an [Elektron Octatrack MKII](https://www.elektron.se/us/octratrack-mkii-explorer). Adding visualization to the music is also really fun [mute84.com/visualizer/02](https://mute84.com/visualizer/02) (HINT: audio on the web is really frustrating... click the screen to start the music lol).
